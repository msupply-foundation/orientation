# Orientation

Welcome to the team! We're thrilled to have you here ðŸŒ±

This is your jumping off point to get you up and running with your work at The mSupply Foundation (TMF).

(It's a work in progress...I really hope you can shape and improve this onboarding experience as you learn!)

## Your first day

* Read the mSupply Foundation [Code of Ethics](https://wiki.sussol.net/doku.php/policy:tmf:code_of_ethics). Chat with Tony/Dhanya if you have any questions about company norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct.
* Sign your contract if you haven't already :) 
* Get your laptop set up. 
* Get [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)! We use this for all company communication.  
* Ask Dhanya to invite you to join the relevant telegram groups. 
* Get your email client set up - we each have a yourname@msupply.foundation email, and a yourname@sussol.net email. You will only need to set up your email client to deal with the `msupply.foundation` email, as all `sussol.net` emails are forwarded on to this email. 
* Add yourself to our shared [TMF Event Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=bXN1cHBseS5mb3VuZGF0aW9uXzQ5NXE0MTFpcDMyZWtzOXAydGU2cGVqbmJjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) and [TMF Non-Availability Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=bXN1cHBseS5mb3VuZGF0aW9uX29qbzZpcmZnY2lybTFyOGg0ZGJwMGRsMjYwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)ðŸ—“. The event calendar is where we track all meetings and upcoming things, and the non-availability one is where we track time when you will not be available. 
* This week, we'll go through some of the resources and intro tasks in the First Week Resources folder. 

## TMF meetings

We have one mandatory full-team meeting - Monday standup at 10am. You'll have a slide on our [stand-up slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n1OHsJlgqrVpCU6_5LdlThO33xgtUGFk2tpgFC9a3Vg/edit) that will need to be updated every week with what you've worked on in the last week, and what you plan to do in the next. 

Don't worry about filling it in for your first week - we'll use it as an opportunity to introduce you and say hi!
