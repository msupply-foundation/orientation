# Introducing üëãüèº

* **Goal**: Introduce yourself
* **Timeline**: Within the first week of you joining The mSupply Foundation
* **Length**: Approximately 300 words

The goal of this blogging project is to introduce yourself, and get used to using Github and PRs! 

The brief is very simple: **write a little about yourself**.

We have a template [here](https://github.com/openmsupply/orientation/blob/main/TMF%20People/intro_template.md) that you can use as a start but you are welcome to add anything you like! 

Some optional topics for you to add:

* Where you grew up
* A problem in the world that you're looking to solve
* Your favourite hobby

**You don't have to cover all these points!**
They're just suggestions to get you started. 

Once you're finished with your post, you can create a pull request for it in this repo! It will be added as a post to the "TMF People" folder where you found the template.
