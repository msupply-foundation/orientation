# Settling in 🍵

* **Goal**: Get comfortable in your new environment 
* **Timeline**: Within the first week of you joining Sussol, but possibly ongoing! 

Starting at a new job is always a bit tough. There's a lot going on and heaps to take in. It's common to want to get right into everything, and that's great! But since the first week can be a bit overwhelming, I wanted to make clear our expectations for this time. 

Here's where we hope you'll get to by the end of your first week here!

* Computer: set up and ready to use ✅
* Email accounts: working ✅
* Telegram: installed, and chatted to at least one person on telegram ✅
* This is important - code of ethics read and signed ✅

* Sussol NZ people: chatted with ✅
* Met at least one of the team outside of NZ! ✅
* Have some idea of the company ethos and history ✅
* Tools (github, google drive) set up and ready to use ✅
