# Settling in 🍵

* **Goal**: Get comfortable in your new environment 
* **Timeline**: Within the first week of you joining The mSupply Foundation, but possibly ongoing! 

Starting at a new job is always a bit tough. There's a lot going on and heaps to take in. It's common to want to get right into everything, and that's great! But since the first week can be a bit overwhelming, I wanted to make clear our expectations for this time. 

Here's where we hope you'll get to by the end of your first week here!
