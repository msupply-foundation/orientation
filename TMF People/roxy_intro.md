# Roxy's Introduction

## About me
I'm going into my 3rd year BCIS student at AUT majoring in software development. I was born in Vietnam, but grew up in NZ and have worked in Japan before for a few years. I love learning about different cultures and travelling to different countries, oh, and also eating! Cat or dog person~? Dogs /o/

## Things I like to do outside of work
Explore, read and game.

## What I want to learn over my internship
I would like to learn more about the mSupply and the different technologies that the organisation uses, and hone my interpersonal and technical skills during my time on the internship
