# Key Terms

## Technology


* LMIS: Logistics Management Information System (e.g. mSupply).
* EMR: Electronic Medical Record (e.g. Tamanu).
* HIS: Health Information System (e.g. DHIS2).
* Offline-first: A program that, while still needing a server connection, does not require a constant internet connection to work. This is important for facilities with unstable internet connections – programs that rely on constant internet connections result in frustrating click-lags and poor usage.
* Open-source: Software that has its code designed to be publicly accessible, with anyone able to view, modify and distribute the code. mSupply Mobile, mSupply Dashboard, Tupaia and Tamanu are already open-source. mSupply Desktop is currently transitioning to an open-source model. 


## Project Management

* Contract: An agreement between BES/TMF and a funding partner to deliver a project within a certain timeframe.
* Milestone: A time-linked obligation that must be completed to fulfil the requirements of a contract. When each milestone is completed, an invoice is raised for payment. This is usually accompanied by a progress report providing evidence of completion of the deliverables within a milestone.
* Deliverable: A specific component or task within a milestone.
* Technical Working Group (TWG): A specially formed group of stakeholders who make key decisions about a project. The TWG may need to call upon individuals with specialist inputs to help inform their decisions, but ultimately the TWG is who signs off on important decisions in the project and milestone delivery.
* Deployment: Implementation of a new software including requirements-gathering, installation, training, and change management activities.
* Requirements-Gathering: The exploratory process of researching and documenting project requirements, primarily done during stakeholder meetings. For mSupply deployments, this will usually involve consultations with people outside the TWG such as the Warehouse Manager, Procurement Officer, and Senior Pharmacists. The result of the requirements-gathering process is a Final Requirements Document, which is signed off by the TWG.
* System Design: A document defining the IT architecture of a planned deployment, including specifications of the hardware and supporting software required.
* Functional Training: A training session held with the TWG and key stakeholders to demo key features of the system before the requirements-gathering process is undertaken. This is to familiarise stakeholders with existing functionality, possibilities for configurations, and to frame requests for customisations.
* User Acceptance Training (UAT): A testing session held with the TWG (and relevant key stakeholders) after the software has been configured and customisations completed, but before group user training begins. Despite the name, it is not really a ‘training’ session; instead, it is a systematic test of each configuration and customisation in the Final Requirements Document, with the TWG confirming each requirement has been met. If any changes are required, these should be noted.
* Group User Training: A basic training session held for a new piece of software with end-users. Every person using the software should attend a group training session. We adopt a Train-the-Trainer approach, where enthusiastic people who pick up the system intuitively during training are identified to be Change Champions. We work with these people to prepare them to lead future training sessions, supporting local ownership of the system. This also ensures there are capable users in-country for minor troubleshooting and ongoing change management.
System Administrator Training: An advanced training session (following Group User Training) with a select group of people who will be involved in operational administration (e.g. adding users) and/or system administration (e.g. server maintenance). Usually involves managers and IT staff only.
* Go-Live: First installation and use of a software in-country, or at a specific health facility. From a technical perspective, this is when the facility computer is synced to the central sever. From a practical perspective, it is when the system starts getting used. A stocktake is the first activity held at mSupply go-live, after which it can be used for all other processes. For mSupply Desktop deployments, our team is usually on-site for go-live, stocktake and for the first week of usage to help integrate the system into workflows and to support change implementation.
* Refresher Training: A training session held with users who have previously used the software, to ‘refresh’ their knowledge or to learn new features.
