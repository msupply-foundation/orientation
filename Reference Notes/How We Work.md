# How We Work 

## Office Hours 👷🏽‍♀️

We work flexible hours, with the general expectation that you will be available between 10am-3pm for any joint meetings. 
We encourage a 30 minute lunch break and 2 x 10 minute tea breaks, but we’re flexible on how you manage your time. 


## Timesheets and Payslips ⏰

Make sure you complete your timesheet in [our accounting app](https://accounts.msupply.org:6710) by the end of the day. 
Please record a short description of the activities you worked on for each time entry (this is for contract purposes in case we get audited!). 
All your initial hours will be under the AA-Nonbill jobcode. As you start working on specific projects, you'll begin using different job codes. 

You’ll receive your payslip by email each fortnight.


## Leave 🏄‍♀️

We have a policy of asking for leave as many days in advance as you want leave, so for example if you want two days leave, ask two days in advance. Contact Tony for all your leave and admin needs :)
