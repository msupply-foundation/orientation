# Ming's Introduction 

## About me
I was born in China and lived in Guangzhou for 17 years. Then I came to New Zealand all alone to have some different experiences. I lived with my aunty\'92s family in Wellington for two years. I went to high school in Wellington and started my university in Auckland. 

## My favourite hobbies
I dance in my spare time. Sometimes I learn by myself, and sometimes I go to the dance studio. I like hanging around with people in the dance studio. I play badminton for fun and competition. Also, I like travelling with my friends. It is great to catch up with old friends and enjoy life with them. 

## My special skills
I play a Chinese instrument called GuZheng. I gain a 10th (out of 10) grade. I used to perform a lot in China when I was young. 

## My personal goals
At this stage, as a graduate, I want to upgrade my skills and engage more in a specific project in computer science. In the future, I want to expand my vision. If possible, I would like to travel to more countries to experience local customs and practices and make friends from different cultural backgrounds. The final goal of my life is to be a nice person and contribute to this world. 

## A problem in the world that I'm looking to solve
I want to solve the problem of sleeping too much. Rather than sleeping, there are many other interesting things I could do. But I can't help sleeping due to the genes (probably).
